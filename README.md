#### I am a Engineering and Applied Science PhD Student. 


I'm a computer engineer with a strong interest in the design of CMOS Integrated Circuits, multisensors embedded platforms and the way they can be connetted into bigger networks.

#### During my studies I deepened advanced topics regarding advanced programming, the design of computer, mechatronic and microelectronic systems.

I work to the Falaphel project as a Research Fellow at National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN), section of Pavia. My professional duties are the design, test and characterization of front-end circuits for next generation High Energy Physics pixel detectors.

#### I'm also collaborating with Sorint.tek working as web developer on the MangroviaIoT platform.
