#### Iâ€™m a Computer Engineer passionate about building high-performance systems at the intersection of hardware and software.

During my PhD at the University of Bergamo, I designed, simulated and characterized front-end circuits in 28nm CMOS for high-energy particle detectors, learning the full integrated circuit design process.

#### I have experience with microcontroller programming, Python automation, and full-stack development, enjoying the challenge of solving complex problems and delivering elegant, efficient solutions.
